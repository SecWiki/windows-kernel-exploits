# MS10-012
```
This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows.
The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sent a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. 
To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must convince the user to initiate an SMB connection to a specially crafted SMB server.
